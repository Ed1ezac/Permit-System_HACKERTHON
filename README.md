## Requirements
If you intend to make additions to this project you need to meet the following (Minimum requirements):
- Php V7.3.0 
- Composer V2.0.11
- Node V14.16.0

## Architecture & Directories
This project's architecture follows the Laravel framework architecture and directory structure that can be [found here](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/structure)

## Local Configuration
- Download and unzip the project
- If you have Visual Studio Code IDE you can use its built-in command processor by clicking `Terminal`->`New Terminal` on the top ribbon menu
- Otherwise fire up your console app *(e.g command prompt on windows)* and navigate to the project folder 
- Install the necessary packages by running `npm i` command
- Compile the javascript & css by running `npm run dev`
- Serve the application by using the artisan command `php artisan serve`
- Navigate to http://localhost:8000 on your browser to view it
- In order to create accounts and log in you will need a database. I uses xampp for that and configured it in the .env file in the project dir

## Testing
In order to test the app you can use Laravel built in testing:
- Create your test file from the commandline e.g. `php artisan make:test MyTest` 
- To run the tests you can use the `php artisan test` command
- An `ExampleTest.php` file exists in the `\tests\` directory of the app to help you get started

Visit the [Laravel documentation on testing](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/testing) to learn more

## Support & Contribution
I dont consider this system worth working on because it was specifically made for a purpose (the hackerthon competition) and I can't think of a way to commercialize it, YET. If you want to, you can clone and continue working on it.

## Evolution
Unfortunately this system is died prematurely before it was born.
